The article delves into the imperative role of inclusive design in modern technology and design processes. It argues for a holistic approach that recognizes and caters to the diversity of human experiences, particularly those of 'edge cases' or individuals whose needs deviate from the 'average' user. The manuscript highlights the limitations of conventional design philosophies that center on the 'average' user, advocating instead for designs that embrace the full spectrum of human diversity. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and co-design methodologies, the authors propose that design can become more inclusive, adaptable, and universally accessible. The text underscores the transformative potential of considering 'edge cases' in the design process, suggesting that such an approach can lead to innovation and solutions that are beneficial for all users. The narrative emphasizes the synergy between technology and human-centred design principles, advocating for a design ethos that is deeply inclusive and reflective of the complex, interconnected world we inhabit.
