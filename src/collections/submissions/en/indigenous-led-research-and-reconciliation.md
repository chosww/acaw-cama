We know that more diversity in research teams leads to better research.Recently there has been an increase in initiatives to support support, promote, and build research capacity with and by Indigenous communities.What can this look like from a research funder perspective, and from the perspective of federal research initiatives? The presentation will provide examples of how NRC is working with Indigenous research partners, to share results knowledge, and wisdom for mutual benefit.
