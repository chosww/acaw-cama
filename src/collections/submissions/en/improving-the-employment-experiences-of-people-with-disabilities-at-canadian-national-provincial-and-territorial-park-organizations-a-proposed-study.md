Canadians with disabilities encounter disproportionately high unemployment rates, approximately double the rate of those without disabilities. Unfortunately, this imbalance extends to Canadian national, provincial, and territorial park organizations, where people with disabilities are significantly underrepresented in the workplace and continue to experience barriers throughout their "Employment Life Cycle." Despite existing park employment initiatives, people with disabilities are hired below market availability, and a lack of detailed knowledge of park-specific employment barriers and facilitators persists.This short document outlines a proposed study that will explore how Canadian national, provincial, and territorial park organizations can improve the park employment experience for people with disabilities, leading to improved recruitment and retention. Through virtual interviews and co-design focus groups, this study aims to highlight prominent barriers encountered by people with disabilities throughout all stages of employment, fostering the development of practical strategies that organizations can use to improve the park employment experience.
