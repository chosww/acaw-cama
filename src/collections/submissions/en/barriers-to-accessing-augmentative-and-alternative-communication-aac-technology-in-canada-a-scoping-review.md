The presentation titled "Barriers to accessing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technology in Canada: A Scoping Review" examines the literature exploring the challenges and obstacles faced by individuals in Canada when attempting to access augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. By identifying these barriers, the presentation aims to shed light on the systemic issues within the Canadian context and provide insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders to address these challenges effectively. Ultimately, the presentation seeks to advocate for improved accessibility and availability of AAC technology to enhance communication and quality of life for individuals with diverse communication needs across Canada.
