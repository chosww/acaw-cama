This text is a proposal to establish accessibility (or, in the context of German academic discussions: Zug√§nglichkeit) as a fundamental concept for transdisciplinary research. It could serve as the basis of a broad research program to investigate technologies and cultures of access as human-technology-world relations and examine them from a global and comparative perspective.
