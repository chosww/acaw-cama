A conversation between Beatriz González Mellídez and Adrian Hermann about accessibility, innovation, and transdisciplinary research. We discuss two funding proposals that we are involved in and that have recently been submitted to the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the two funding schemes "DATIpilot Innovation Communities" and "Käte Hamburger International Centres".
